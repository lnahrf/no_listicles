This add-on was made out of need. It uses a set of regex patterns to determine which article is a listicle (a low-quality list article, typically generated by AI).

#### IMPORTANT: This add-on DOES NOT USE AI (I bet that is refreshing to hear).

... and is not published to the chrome/ff webstore (because I don't want to deal with that). You are welcome to clone the repository and add it to your browser by enabling developer mode.

#### It is not perfect - but it works
From time to time an article that is not a listicle might get caught in the mix and removed from the feed.

### Requirements
- node v20.10.0^
- npm v10.2.3^

Run the following commands and then add the `no_listicles` directory as a developer add-on on chrome.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lnahrf/no_listicles.git
cd no_listicles
npm install
npm run build
```
