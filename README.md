This add-on was made out of need. It uses a completely arbitrary scoring system to determine which article is a listicle (a low-quality list article, typically generated by AI).

#### IMPORTANT: This add-on DOES NOT USE AI (I bet that is refreshing to hear).

... and is not published to the chrome add-on store (because I don't want to deal with that). You are welcome to clone the repository and add it to your chromium by enabling developer mode.

#### It is not perfect - but it works
From time to time an article that is not a listicle might get caught in the mix and removed from the feed.
The scoring system is partially built upon a blacklist of words associated with listicle-type articles.
My goal with the blacklist was to try and keep things levelled, and not overdo it.
You are more than welcome to improve the blacklist as you see fit, either in this repository or in your own fork/clone.

The blacklist is located in `enums/blacklist.js`.

### Requirements
- node v20.10.0^
- npm v10.2.3^

Run the following commands and then add the `no_listicles` directory as a developer add-on on chrome.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lnahrf/no_listicles.git
cd no_listicles
npm install
npm run build
```
